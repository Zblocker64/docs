## akash keys migrate

Migrate keys from the legacy (db-based) Keybase

### Synopsis

Migrate key information from the legacy (db-based) Keybase to the new keyring-based Keybase.
For each key material entry, the command will prompt if the key should be skipped or not. If the key
is not to be skipped, the passphrase must be entered. The key will only be migrated if the passphrase
is correct. Otherwise, the command will exit and migration must be repeated.

It is recommended to run in 'dry-run' mode first to verify all key migration material.


```
akash keys migrate [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --dry-run   Run migration without actually persisting any changes to the new Keybase
  -h, --help      help for migrate
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --home string              The application home directory (default "/home/ericu/.akash")
      --keyring-backend string   Select keyring's backend (os|file|test) (default "os")
      --keyring-dir string       The client Keyring directory; if omitted, the default 'home' directory will be used
      --output string            Output format (text|json) (default "text")
```
