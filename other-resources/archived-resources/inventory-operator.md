# Copy of Inventory Operator

* When your Akash Provider was initially installed a step was included to also install the Akash Inventory Operator.  In this step we will make any necessary changes to the inventory operator for your specific persisent storage type (I.e. `beta1`, `beta2`, or \``beta3`).

### Default Helm Chart -  values.yaml file

* The `values.yaml` file for the inventory operator defaults are as follows
* As the default cluster storage type includes `beta2` - no update is necessary if this is your persistent storage type and no further action is necessary for inventory operator and you may skip the remainer of this step
* If your persistent storage type is instead `beta1` or `beta3` proceed to the `Update Cluster Storage Cluster Setting` section next

```
# Default values for inventory-operator.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

  repository: ghcr.io/akash-network/provider
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

inventoryConfig:
  # Allow users to specify cluster storage options
  cluster_storage:
    - default
    - beta2
  exclude:
    nodes: []
    node_storage: []
```

#### Update Cluster Storage Cluster Setting

* Again this step is only necessary if you have `beta1` or `beta3` persistent storage type
* Use this command to update the cluster storage settings
* In the following command example we are updating the chart with `beta3` persistent storage type such as - `inventoryConfig.cluster_storage[1]=beta3`.  Adjust as necessary for your needs.
* The `default` label can be used and left as is in all circumstances.

```
helm upgrade inventory-operator akash/akash-inventory-operator -n akash-services --set inventoryConfig.cluster_storage[0]=default,inventoryConfig.cluster_storage[1]=beta3
```

#### Expected Output

```
