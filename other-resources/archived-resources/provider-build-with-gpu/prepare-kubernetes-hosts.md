# Prepare Kubernetes Hosts

Akash Providers utilize an underlying Kubernetes cluster.  Begin your Akash Provider build by preparing the hosts that the Kubernetes cluster will be built on.

Follow the instructions in this [guide](../../../providers/build-a-cloud-provider/kubernetes-cluster-for-akash-providers/) to prepare the hosts.  Complete steps 1-6 in the linked guide and then return to proceed with the steps of this `Provider Build with GPU` guide.
